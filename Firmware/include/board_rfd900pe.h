/// Board-specific definitions and documentation for the RFD900P,
/// Version 1.2 onwards.
/// 
/// The RFD900 board provides pads for programming
/// the Si1000 via the debug port.
/// The pads are on the single horizontal header on the bottom of the board.
/// Pin 1 = GND, Pin 2 = +5V, Pin 3 = C2D, Pin 4 = C2CK
///
/// The SiLabs programmer has a 10-pin ribbon cable, for which you will
/// need to make an adapter.  The User Guide, linked from the page here:
///
/// http://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/Pages/USBDebug.aspx
/// describes the pinout of the cable.
///
/// Connect the SiLabs debug adapter to the RFD900 V1.2+ as follows:
///
/// Debug Adapter Pin:                 	RFD900A V1.2+ 9W header pin (J2)
///
///        2 <--------------------------> GND 	(Pin 2)
///        4 <--------------------------> C2D 	(Pin 4)
///        7 <--------------------------> C2CK	(Pin 5)
///       10 <--------------------------> +5V	(Pin 3)
///
///
/// If you are making your own adapter board for the RFD900, note that
/// whilst the stock firmware requires the ENABLE pin be tied low,
/// it is a flow control input to the SiK radio firmware.
